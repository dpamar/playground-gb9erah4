# BrainFuck part 6 - 16-bit integers

The goal of this playground is to support 16-bit integers on a regular 8-bit BF machine

The different steps will be
* define a memory structure for 16 bits
* define an overriden version of 
  * , and .
  * < and >
  * \+ and -
  * [ and ]
* try a sample code (Fibonacci sequence)
* find a way to mix 8 and 16-bit integers (to improve performance)

Have fun !
